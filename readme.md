# IBM Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Launch Analysis

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate capstone.

The objective is to analyze SpaceX launch data and build machine learning models to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, enabling cost estimation and decision support.
